# CSS Dev Conference 2017: Web Animation Workshop

> This repo was originally private since I was not sure whether the notes were allowed to be public at the time. Because Sarah and Val are awesome, they have given me permission to share these. As a result, in order to keep everything consolidated, I've moved the notes to my CSSDevConf2017 repo and all further updates will be made there. See you there!
