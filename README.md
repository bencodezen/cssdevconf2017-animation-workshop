Sarah and Val will also show you:

- What CSS transforms, transitions and keyframe animations can do and how to use them effectively in your work
- Best practices and principles to follow to ensure the animations you create are adding something positive to the user experience, not distracting from it.
- How to bend SVGs to your will- both regarding optimization and performance, as well as creating dazzling visual effects that bring your project to life.
