# CSS Dev Conference 2017: Web Animation Workshop

> This repo was originally private since I was not sure whether the notes were allowed to be public at the time. Because Sarah and Val are awesome, they have given me permission to share these. As a result, in order to keep everything consolidated, I've moved the notes to my CSSDevConf2017 repo and all further updates will be made there. See you there!

## Description

Get up and running with web animation in less time than it would take to read all the tutorials you have bookmarked. In this workshop, you'll get an in-depth look at animating with CSS, JavaScript, and SVG through hands-on exercises while learning how to make your project stand out from the competition with effective animation.

By coding along with Sarah and Val in this workshop, youâ€™ll learn:

- The essentials of CSS animation
- Principles of UI/UX for animation
- Basics of TweenMax and TimelineMax
- SVG workflow and optimization
- SVG animation, both with a library and without

Sarah and Val will also show you:

- How to choose which web animation technologies are best for your projects, with an overview of the animation landscape, explaining which tools to choose and why
- What CSS transforms, transitions and keyframe animations can do and how to use them effectively in your work
- Best practices and principles to follow to ensure the animations you create are adding something positive to the user experience, not distracting from it.
- How to bend SVGs to your will- both regarding optimization and performance, as well as creating dazzling visual effects that bring your project to life.
